# Eastern Standard Developer Challenge

## Overview

One of our favorite clients has referred us to one of their colleagues who's having trouble with an application demo they're supposed to present to the CIO.

They hired a "rock star" freelance developer to begin building the application, but it's not going as well as they had hoped. The developer originally promised a working prototype in a week. It's now been a month and he's saying it'll take at least another week.

Ultimately, the application is supposed to be a robust management platform for their employees to manage their personal information, submit timesheets, and perform a host of other data management tasks. It will also need to link to other data sources/other internal applications at the organization. For now, though, all they want is a prototype of a few basic functions to demo to the CIO.

They want us to fix this demo, and fast! It's Monday and they need to show something to the CIO on Friday. __For the sake of this exercise, assume you have to fix what's here rather than doing something completely from the ground-up.__

## The application needs to do the following for the sake of the demo:
* Allow employees to login and edit their employee records
* An employee record should consist of:
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Date of Birth
  * Phone Number
  * Office number (i.e. the room in the building in which they work)
  * Employee category (full time, part time, intern, contractor)
  * Allow administrators to login and edit any employee record

## In addition to the demo, the client wants a few things from us:
* They've asked for an audit of the code. They want to understand whether this new developer really has the code chops they claimed they did
* If we make it through the demo, we have the opportunity to take the project over. They want to know what you'd recommend long term. 

## Your presentation should be:

* Show off your demo for the client as if you were showing it to them
* Provide your overview of the original architecture, before you modified anything. How does it work/how's it set up? What's good? What's bad?
* Describe some of the specific things you changed for the demo / walk us through the code. 
* Note any specific issues/bugs you found in the code.
* What would you recommend the client do from here if they wanted to continue building on this and turn it into a larger scale employee management system? Feel free to simply talk through it or show us a version that you built and why you chose to do it differently.
